### General
*Q:* What is the difference between a symmetric and assymetric cryptographic system?
*A:* Symmetric systems require sharing the same key among 2 or more parties, and assymetric systems uses N key pairs for each party participating in the system.

*Q:* What is the difference between a block cipher and a stream cipher?
*A:* A block cipher encrypts blocks of bytes, and a stream cipher encrypts a continuous steam of bytes.

*Q:* Name some symmetric key ciphers.
*A:* AES (Rijndael), RC4, MARS, RC6, Serpent and Twofish (anything that uses a shared key) 

*Q:* Name some asymmetric key ciphers.
*A:* RSA, Diffie-Helman, , RC6, Serpent and Twofish (anything that uses a shared key)
